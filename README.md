# Fandomverse readme
**Fandomverse** is a project made via collaborative efforts of Team Revolters to showcase for the Hackathon "In house Competition" conducted via JIIT OPTICA hub.

#### BRIEF
Team Revolters **Fandomverse** sought to create a partially active, under development model of a fandoms community building Web App
In its Alpha version, we have decided to form surveys, user registrations and a main webpage that displays the most popular and trendy fandoms targeting Gen Z.
We hope to keep this app under development for a while and expand its usage/ functions.

### PROJECT MAINTAINED BY: TEAM REVOLTERS:
                          including members- * NANCY SONI
                                           - * Gagandeep Magan
                                           - * Aayush Walia
                                           
### GET STARTED
     You can use this project for now by either visiting the link shared by us, or setup the files provided for the project in the 
     exact fashion we have addressed in this github repo, although the repo will be constantly updated,
     its advised to fork it completely via git and build by your own from a compatible/supported version.
     OR you can simply download the files.

### Usability
The inspiration for this project came from our own personal experience in the first year of UNI, in 2020 when we couldn't find suitable groups to socialize with.
Hence for the hackathon we decided to develop a community where people can reach out for help with their fellow students or seniors.

In the future , we will create different groups for separate factions of a fandom where you will be able to use it either as a newsletters app to stay update or a social media / chat like app to connect with others. 

FOR THE ALPHA VERSION, it is a statistical comparison app where over a users dashboard, they will be able to see and compare their fandoms against other communities,
you could call it a model trend analyzer.
